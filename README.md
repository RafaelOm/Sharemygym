-Description:
The application to develop is focused on a healthy life, where users can upload their sports routines and diets to this application, these routines or diets may be rated (Similar to the Instagram Likes system) by other users, but the evaluation of Those who are following a certain diet or routine will have a greater weight, in addition those users, gym trainers (They would have a verification by the application), would enter a ranking system. Another function of the application that we have thought is that users who are following a certain routine or diet can upload their progress to the application, to promote communication between users, in addition to implementing a basic Android / iOS application based on the operation of pedometers to be able to synchronize with the database the activity carried out by bicycle or walking (It is a very risky function of the application, it is not sure that it will be implemented).
